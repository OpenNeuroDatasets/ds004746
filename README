This dataset includes 395 participants who were included in the pre-registered sample of the placebo fMRI paper of the Paingen study. Data include anatomical maps, field maps and functional data from the placebo task (4 runs) of each participant. Note that participants are from the Colorado Community Twin Sample, and thus many of them are dizygotic or monozygotic twins (as noted in the participants.tsv file). The derivatives directory includes beta estimates of each condition and participant, from the participant-level fMRI analysis, as well as the corresponding behavioral data as a csv file. Line number X in the merged_firstlvl_stim_betas_to_share.csv file corresponds to image X in the 4th dimension of the merged_firstlvl_stim_betas_sm_6mm.nii.gz file (i.e., the first line of the csv file corresponds to the first image in the nifti file, the second run to the second image, etc.).

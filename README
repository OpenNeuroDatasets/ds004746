This dataset includes 395 participants who were included in the pre-registered sample of the placebo fMRI paper. Data include anatomical maps, field maps and functional data from the placebo task (4 runs) of each participant. Each participant participated in a single neuroimaging session (when session number is larger than 1, that is because participants did not complete the experiment in the first session for some reason, and returned on a different day).
